<h2 id="beginning">In the Beginning</h2>

<p>
Rent A Pet began with a family that loved dogs. George Smith and his wife Carol
owned two Irish Setters. These dogs were pets to the Smith family children and
extended family members.
</p>

<p>
One day as George was walking his dogs in the park, he noticed how they attracted
the attention of passing women. A young woman remarked that she would love to
have a big dog like that to walk, but she had a small apartment and couldn't keep
a large dog.
</p>

<p>
This brief encounter sparked an idea. What if people wanted companionship of pets
without the responsibility of ownership? Perhaps people would be willing to rent
a pet for a short period of time.

<h2 id="today">Where We Are Today</h2>

<p>
After weighing the pros and cons, the Smiths started Rent A Pet in the fall of
1980. The business offered companionship without the cost or responsibility of
pet ownership.
</p>

<p>
The company began by renting dogs only, but has since expanded to include cats,
horses, pigs, and snakes.
