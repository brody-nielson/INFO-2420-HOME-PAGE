<p>
Rent A Pet began with a family that loved dogs. George Smith and his wife Carol
owned two Irish Setters. These dogs were pets to the Smith family children and
extended family members.
</p>

<p>
One day as George was walking his dogs in the park, he noticed how they attracted
the attention of passing women. A young woman remarked that she would love to
have a big dog like that to walk, but she had a small apartment and couldn't keep
a large dog.
</p>

<p>
This brief encounter sparked an idea. What if people wanted companionship of pets
without the responsibility of ownership? Perhaps people would be willing to rent
a pet for a short period of time.

After weighing the pros and cons, the Smiths started Rent A Pet in the fall of
1980. The business offered companionship without the cost or responsibility of
pet ownership.
</p>

<p>
The company began by renting dogs only, but has since expanded to include cats,
horses, pigs, and snakes.

The company employs its own veterinarian and animal trainer. Pets are trained
daily, and Rent A Pet has never had an accident involving rental animals.

Customers include senior citizens in retirement homes, young adults seeking
companionship, entertainers, and party hosts. Snakes are often rented for
Halloween or shock-value events.
