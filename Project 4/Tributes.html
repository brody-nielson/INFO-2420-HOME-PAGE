<h1>Tributes: Rent A Pet</h1>

<p>
The following tributes come from satisfied customers who have experienced the
unique companionship provided by Rent A Pet.

<p>
My name is Bessie Anderson and I live in a retirement community that prohibits
pets. I always wanted a small dog to take for walks, but I thought it was not
possible.
</p>

<p>
After discovering Rent A Pet, I found a lovable basset hound named Sophie. She
was delivered to my apartment one Saturday morning, and we enjoyed a long walk
in the nearby park.
</p>

<p>
The Rent A Pet staff picked her up later, and I did not have to worry about
feeding or watering her. We now have a regular appointment every Saturday when
the weather permits.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for giving me something to look forward to each week.
</p>

<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Bessie Anderson</p>

<p>
I am a single college student living in an apartment with three other guys. I
always wanted a large dog to run with or play catch with in the park.
</p>

<p>
With the help of Rent A Pet, I found Kamikaze, a German Shepherd. He loves to run
in the summer, cross-country ski in the winter, and play Frisbee.
</p>

<p>
We attract a lot of attention in the park, and I even met my fiancée Janice
during a game of keep away. Until I can have a yard of my own, Rent A Pet allows
me to enjoy the companionship of a great dog.
</p>

<p>Thanks to Rent A Pet,</p>
<p>Jason Hutchingson</p>

<p>
My business requires frequent travel, which makes owning a pet difficult. I
also enjoy surprising and shocking my friends with unusual pets.
</p>

<p>
Rent A Pet has been the perfect solution. I have rented a snake, a Saint
Bernard, a pot belly pig, and an iguana.
</p>

<p>
I can enjoy exotic pets without worrying about their long-term care. Rent A Pet
has added spice to my life.

<p>
As a young girl, I developed a love of horses, but growing up in the city meant
I never had the chance to own one.
</p>

<p>
Rent A Pet offers several horses for riders of different skill levels and
delivers them directly to the trails where I want to ride.
</p>

<p>
Because I can request the same horse each time, I have become comfortable with
my riding skills and the abilities of the horse. Rent A Pet made a dream come
true.
</p>

<p>Thanks for making a dream come true,</p>
<p>Melinda Morrison</p>
